## About

This is a fan-run site about the podcast [You're Wrong About](https://yourewrongabout.com).

[Mike](https://twitter.com/RottenInDenmark) and [Sarah](https://twitter.com/remember_sarah) often make references to movies, TV shows, books, or other podcasts - this is a place where those references are collected.

### Why did you make this?

While listening to the podcast, I often found myself thinking _damn, I've never seen Basic Instinct, so I don't get that bisexual joke - I should watch that_, and then immediately forgetting about it. Then one day I said - no more! And started writing an actual list of all the pop-culture references as I listened to episodes.

Eventually, I thought maybe someone else might find this useful, so now this website is a thing.

### Where's the entry for [insert favourite episode here]?

Look, I'm just one lady with a full-time job who likes the same podcast as you. If you'd like to beat me to it, learn about contributing [here](/contributing).

### I found a typo!

Sorry, my laptop keyboard is dying and the `a`, `r`, and `s` keys need superhuman strength to actually use. Please either make the edits [yourself](/contributing) or [create an issue](https://github.com/yourewrongaboutthefootnotes/yourewrongaboutthefootnotes.github.io/issues).

### Grammer

[Who gives a fuck about an Oxford Comma?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Comma_(song)) There are no hard rules here about Oxford Commas, title casing, or British v. American spellings. Follow your heart.

### Post structure

There's a draft post at `/_posts/draft-post` that you can copy and paste. When you create a new post, please follow the naming convention, which is `[release-date-of-episode-in-YYYY-MM-DD-format]-[episode-title-in-kebab-case].markdown`. For example, `2018-05-02-the-satanic-panic.markdown`.

Every post should begin with a link to the episode. Following that, any references you want to add should follow this structure:

```
> Quote

[Timestamp] [Emoji] [Name of movie/book/whatever](Link to movie/book/whatever)

----
```

Recommended emojis are: 📚 🎥 📺 🎙️, but other emojis are welcome.

### Reference sources

If possible, Wikipedia is preferred. Otherwise, preference database-style sites such as IMDb over links to streaming services, as not all content is equally available across different locations.

Additionally, if it's possible, a more specific link is preferred over a more generic one. For example, if Sauron is referenced, linking to [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron) instead of [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings).

### What counts as a reference?

Yeah, this is a good question. When I started compiling these sources, I was primarily looking for books to read, movies to watch, or podcasts to listen to. With that in mind, I didn't list references such as news articles, governmental studies, or academic papers. If that's a project that interests you, this site can absolutely be the place to host it - but you will need to do the work in finding those references.
