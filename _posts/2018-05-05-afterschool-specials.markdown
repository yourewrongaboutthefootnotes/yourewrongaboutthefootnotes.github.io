----

> that makes me think of how Brokeback Mountain came out when I was in high school

28:41 🎥 [Brokeback Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain)

----

> as someone who had been writing slash Newsies fan fiction for years at that time

28:45 🎥 [Newsies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsies)

----

> I remember when Milk came out, watching it and being really surprised and realising that I hadn't seen before joyful sex scenes

29:12 🎥 [Milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_(2008_American_film))

----

> I was also really impressed with one that was in the late 80s about two sisters, one slim and one overweight, magically switch personalities, giving them a new appreciation of each other

29:44 📺 [Through Thick & Thin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Afterschool_Special#Season_24_(1995%E2%80%9396))

34:50 📺 [Starsky & Hutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starsky_%26_Hutch)

📺 [Cheers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers)

----

> I feel like some of the void that the Afterschool Special used to fill is filled by shows like Teen Mom

35:38 📺 [Teen Mom]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom)

----

> and you flick through like 800 things and you get completely overwhelmed and you're like "I'm going to watch the first 45 minutes of Heat again"

36:00 🎥 [Heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_(1995_film))

37:52 📺 [Duck Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Dynasty)

----

37:59 🎶 [Beyonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9#2016%E2%80%932018:_Lemonade_and_Everything_Is_Love)

----

> we have this idea that there's this 1950s that we can go back to, but so much of that for us is constructed from fucking Leave It to Beaver

43:37 📺 [Leave It to Beaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver)

----

> there's one about a girl with juvenile arthritis who again is sort of cured and she re-joins society

44:26 📺 [The Heartbreak Winner: One Girl's Struggle For Olympic Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Afterschool_Special#Season_8_(1979%E2%80%9380))

----

> HBO a couple of years ago did a really good documentary about the Pam Smart trial, which was the narrative that was the basis for To Die For, which I think is Nicole Kidman's finest hour. Oh my god, I love that movie, I love that book too

1:01:40 📺 [Killing All the Right People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_All_the_Right_People)
