> and this week we are talking about The Godfather, which is neither a political nor a historical myth, but, we'll get there

1:01 🎥 [The Godfather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather)

> I think a lot of movies from that period have become like that - Jaws is another one

> one of the reasons why the Mona Lisa is really famous is because it was one of the first paintings to depict a commoner rather than royalty, and it was one of the first paintings to do realistic three dimensions

> and it's the same with something like The French Connection that was one of the first movies to do these chaotic chase scenes through a crowded city

> there's a book called 'How the Irish Became White' about how Irish immigrants when they first started arriving in America in the mid 19th century were seen as unambiguously ethnically other

> all of the ugly stuff that you hear about immigrants now, it was word-for-word the same stuff about Sicilians. And all the stuff we talked about in Crack Babies too

> so the book The Godfather comes out of Mario Puzo - is he cashing in his own Italian heritage? Like, does he have any first-hand knowledge of the mob, or is he just reading these cases and kind of extrapolating?

> it's also interesting that in The Sopranos in the 90s the characters are always watching and talking about The Godfather

> it's like the story that Oliver Stone tells about, y'know, he makes Wall Street, which ends with its main characters being indicted, and then there's a generation of young guys watch it and they decide based on that that they're gonna become Wall Street stockbrokers

20:06 🎥 [Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_(1987_film))

> the gangster movies that had come before The Godfather were like, Little Caesar and the original Scarface, and y'know, these movies where wise guys who are not leading men, not supposed to have sex appeal, not to be these complex anti-heroes, they were just villains

23:32 🎥 [Little Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Caesar_(film))

🎥 [Scarface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface_(1932_film))

> that happens because a guy who is clearly Frank Sinatra, Johnny Fontane, needs this Hollywood executive guy to cast him in a movie

> Francis Ford Coppola has attempted to start his own movie studio, and he's taken out a loan from Warner Bros, or from Warner, to make some films, and one of them is George Lucas' movie THX something something

> that's weird because, with movie magic, you don't have to know that anyone's short, like Tom Cruise is the size of Stalin, and nobody has any idea because all of the actresses are shorter than him, and they shoot him from below. Like Gandalf.

37:49 🎥 [Gandalf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf)

----

> it is also interesting that these movies really are like, dark and kind of an indictment of this entire culture, and yet, their actual cultural impact was to glorify this culture, same with Goodfellas and Casino and everything else

44:48 🎥 [Goodfellas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodfellas)

🎥 [Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_(1995_film))

> it's an indictment of something that its legacy glorifies, kind of like the song Born in the U.S.A.

50:57 🎶 [Born in the U.S.A.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_the_U.S.A._(song))

> should've listened when our grandparents said that Elvis shouldn't be shaking his hips on TV
