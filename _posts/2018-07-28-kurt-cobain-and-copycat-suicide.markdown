> I was really into listening to movie scores on tape: Jurassic Park and Dracula, Bram Stoker's Dracula specifically, that's what I was really into. And I think I had just kinda started to like, dip my toes in the water with Radiohead, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, and similar stuff. Yeah, I guess I kinda liked Pearl Jam

> why wasn't this brought up in Heathers? If all of the teachers hadn't been so loopy someone could've been like "Heather's suicide note is actually unusual and seems fake"

> and with John List, it's similar to Jonestown, it's similar to the suicide of Budd Dwyer, which we talked about in our Snuff Films episode. Which was also a film that Kurt Cobain watched repeatedly

> this was this like cartoony poster that said "The 27 Club" and it Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison, and Kurt Cobain. Speaking of glorifying suicides, that's like ... not a great idea. It's also glorifying dangerous drug use, to be fair. Absolutely. And I believe since, Amy Winehouse has joined that club
