This is a fan-run site about the podcast [You're Wrong About](https://yourewrongabout.com).

[Mike](https://twitter.com/RottenInDenmark) and [Sarah](https://twitter.com/remember_sarah) often make references to movies, TV shows, books, or other podcasts - this is a place where those references are collected.

### Why did you make this?

While listening to the podcast, I often found myself thinking _damn, I've never seen Basic Instinct, so I don't get that bisexual joke - I should watch that_, and then immediately forgetting about it. Then one day I said - no more! And started writing an actual list of all the pop-culture references as I listened to episodes.

Eventually, I thought maybe someone else might find this useful, so now this website is a thing.

### Where's the entry for [insert favourite episode here]?

Look, I'm just one lady with a full-time job who likes the same podcast as you. If you'd like to beat me to it, learn about contributing [here](/contributing).

### I found a typo!

Sorry, my laptop keyboard is dying and the `a`, `r`, and `s` keys need superhuman strength to actually use. Please either make the edits [yourself](/contributing) or [create an issue](https://github.com/yourewrongaboutthefootnotes/yourewrongaboutthefootnotes.github.io/issues).
